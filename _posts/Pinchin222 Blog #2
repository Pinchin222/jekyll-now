I am super far behind but really like this class so I am going to try to continue. I am slowly figuring out how to use git-hub, I completed the free rooms in beginning networking on gohackme and
submitted them for review as well as this blog. I have 4 babies under the age of 5 and am sole supporter of our household so I am always extremely tight on time so I 
appreciate your turn in philosophy.It reallistically gives mea chance where I may not have one otherwise.
