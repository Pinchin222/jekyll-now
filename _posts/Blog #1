First and second week, Learning hou to manage time. Was instructed to login to gohackme and do the first "room" which entails learning the lessons and then answering the chapters questions.
In order to accomplish this, I had to use other online resourced and literature to learn how to do the activities required.A great example of this is learning to use the ping function.I went to 
man ping page for any and all info in regard to this lab.
I quickly figured out the clues given in asterics that help you to realise the answers to the questions.At the end of this, I copied the incorect link and submitted it,hopefully now the second
attempt is corrct.
